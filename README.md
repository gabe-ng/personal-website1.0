# Personal Website

This repository holds the code for the first version of my personal website.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a page that could showcase what I know, what I've done, and a little about who I am and what I like. This is only the first version and has since been updated. You can view my new site's repository [here](https://github.com/gabe-ng/gabe-ng.github.io).

## Technology Used

This site is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/).

Thanks for stopping by!
